              Caitlin Clark just did something no athlete has done since Michael
              Jordan
            </h1>
            <img src="./images/news1.webp" alt="" />

            <p>
              Breakout basketball star Caitlin Clark has a new achievement that
              hasn’t been accomplished since Michael Jordan.
            </p>
            <p>
              The WNBA player signed a multiyear deal with Wilson Sporting Goods
              Co., the league’s official basketball supplier, for “signature
              basketball collections celebrating Clark’s continued legacy,” the
              company announced Tuesday.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wilson said that Clark will “test, advise and provide feedback on
              a range” of its basketball products, become a brand ambassador and
              release new collections that celebrate her throughout the rest of
              2024. In addition, she will “creatively direct her first-ever
              signature basketball line” that will roll out later this year.
              Financial terms of the deal were not released.
            </p>
            <p>
              She’s the first-ever female athlete to have her own collection
              with Wilson, a company spokesperson told CNN, with the series
              being built similar to Jordan’s collection in the 1980s, which
              included signature basketballs.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Wilson has been with me across some of the most pivotal moments
              in my career so far, and I couldn’t be more excited to continue
              driving basketball forward alongside them,” Clark said in a press
              release. “It feels surreal to have my own basketball collection,
              and to affect what that means for future generations of athletes.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The first collection released Tuesday on Wilson’s website, with a
              limited collection of gold-colored basketballs featuring a drawing
              of Clark along with her signature.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wilson, which has produced the basketballs for the NBA for several
              decades, became the official game ball of the WNBA in 2020. The
              company also sells basketballs with WNBA team logos on them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clark, the no. 1 draft pick, joined the Indiana Fever earlier this
              month and has been a boon for the league since: Her debut drew an
              average of 2.1 million viewers on ESPN2, ESPN+ and Disney+, making
              it the most watched WNBA game in more than two decades.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nike is also reportedly on the verge of signing Clark to design
              her shoe line, but no official deal has been formally announced.
              She also has sponsorship deals with State Farm, Gatorade, Panini
              and others, valued at around $3 million.

              Mother sues LaMelo Ball after he allegedly drove over 11-year-old
              son's foot and broke it at a fan event
            </h1>
            <img src="./images/news2.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              A North Carolina mother has filed a lawsuit against Charlotte
              Hornets star LaMelo Ball and the team alleging that he ran over
              her 11-year-old son’s foot with his car at a fan event last fall,
              according to WSOC-TV.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tamaira McRae was with her son, Angell Joseph, at a Hornets fan
              event at the Spectrum Center in October. As the event was ending,
              fans started going up to players as they left the arena and drove
              away.
            </p>
            <p>
              Joseph, McRae said, went up to Ball and asked him for his
              autograph. “He was like, ’LaMelo I love you. I love you, sign my …
              give me your autograph. Can you sign it for me?’” she told
              WSCO-TV.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ball didn’t sign anything for Joseph. instead "accelerated his
              vehicle forward suddenly" and ran over Joseph's foot and broke
              it." Further specifics on his injury aren't known, but McRae said
              the recovery process for both her and her son was incredibly
              difficult to deal with.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their attorney, Cameron DeBrun, told WSOC-TV that they would have
              filed a claim with Ball’s insurance but the police report from the
              incident was missing key information. That’s part of what led them
              to the lawsuit. They also included the Hornets in the lawsuit, as
              the incident took place at their annual "Purple and Teal Day"
              event.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to the lawsuit, per The Athletic, Ball was negligent
              while operating his vehicle "without maintaining proper control of
              it" and failing to "yield the right of way to a pedestrian" and to
              "apply his breaks in time to avoid an incident." The Hornets, the
              lawsuit said, didn't "provide adequate security and pedestrian
              control measures in the Spectrum Center employee exit" at their
              fan event. The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday in Mecklenburg County
              Superior Court.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ball appeared in just 22 games for the Hornets last season, his
              fourth with the franchise, due to an ankle injury. He still
              averaged a career-high 23.9 points and eight assists per game. The
              22-year-old will enter the first year of a five-year, $204 million
              contract extension with the team this fall.

              Celtics steal Game 1 from Pacers, pass first real test in dramatic
              fashion: 'That s--- was chaos'
            </h1>
            <img src="./images/news3b.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              BOSTON — Everyone wanted to know how the Celtics would respond to
              their first real test of the NBA playoffs. Tuesday's Game 1 of the
              Eastern Conference finals ultimately provided the answer:
              Chaotically.
            </p>
            <p>
              "That's a great word," said Boston's Jayson Tatum, "because that
              s*** was chaos. That s*** was wild."
            </p>
            <p>
              Jaylen Brown's mad-dash 3-pointer with six seconds left in the
              fourth quarter sent the game to an extra period, and Tatum's
              back-to-back three-point plays in the final 75 seconds of overtime
              put a 133-128 win out of reach from the feisty Indiana Pacers. Yet
              somehow we are left to wonder if they are clutch or not.
            </p>
            <p>
              This will be the sticking point on sports talk shows on Wednesday.
              Brown told himself something else.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Before the inbounds, I was just talking to myself: ‘If I get this
              shot, it’s going in,’" said Brown, who posted a 26-7-5 in 44:25.
              "I was just telling myself the whole time, ‘If you get it, it’s
              going up, and it’s going in.’”
            </p>
            <p>
              You are clutch if you are victorious, I guess, but there were
              plenty of times Boston felt anything but.
            </p>
            <p>
              Brown's turnover with 4:39 remaining in regulation of a two-point
              game was Exhibit A. He telegraphed a pass that he threw directly
              to Pascal Siakam, whose dunk on the other end gave Indiana a
              108-104 lead.
            </p>
            <p>
              That malfunction was topped by Tatum's pass to no one with 1:48
              left in overtime. When Pacers point guard Tyrese Haliburton
              corralled the careless turnover, Boston's Derrick White fouled him
              on a 3-point attempt in transition, gifting Indiana a trio of free
              throws. Haliburton made all three for a 123-121 lead.
            </p>
            <p>
              "I'm so glad we won the game," said Tatum, "because I would've
              been sick." The only one who played with poise throughout the
              night, it seemed, was Boston's Jrue Holiday, who scored 20 of his
              season-high 28 points after halftime, adding eight assists, seven
              boards and three steals.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Jrue came out and balled, man," said Brown. "He’s the reason why
              we won this game.”
            </p>
            <p>
              There were more meltdowns. The Celtics coughed up a 13-point lead
              in the final minutes of the third quarter. Their fourth-quarter
              offense got stuck in a muddy mixture of isolation, 3-pointers and
              isolation 3-pointers. They flubbed the open threes they did
              manufacture — until Brown made his in Siakam's grill.
            </p>
            <p>
              “We didn’t necessarily play well enough where we may have deserved
              to win," said Tatum, whose night netted game-highs of 36 points,
              12 rebounds and a +20 rating. "JB gave us a second chance by
              hitting that shot, and we just talked about it in the huddle.
              ‘We’ve got a second chance. Let’s take advantage of it.’”
            </p>
            <p>
              The Celtics had more lives than Kenny from "South Park," and
              Indiana granted most of them. With his team leading 117-114 inside
              of 30 seconds remaining in regulation, Haliburton inexplicably
              dribbled out of bounds. Rather than attempt a game-tying 3, White
              missed a layup, and Tatum missed the follow-up — a fadeaway jump
              shot — and again the Pacers had the ball, a three-point lead and
              the game in their hands.
            </p>
            <p>
              And again they resuscitated Boston, throwing the ensuing inbounds
              pass off of Siakam's hands. Celtics ball. Eight seconds left.
              Holiday feeds Brown in the corner. "Bang!" yelped ESPN's Mike
              Breen. "Bang!" “Man, that was a tough shot," said Celtics veteran
              Al Horford. "A very tough shot.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “It’s simple: Big-time players make big-time plays," added Tatum.
              "That was a hell of a shot.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “This loss is totally on me," said Pacers coach Rick Carlisle,
              unprompted. "With 10 seconds in regulation, we should’ve just
              taken the timeout, advanced the ball, found a way to get in, made
              a free throw or two and ended the game, but it didn’t happen, and
              we made some other mistakes, but our guys just need to concentrate
              on fighting the way they fought in this game from start to finish,
              and we’ll be back Thursday.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The Pacers were not without their positives, either. They
              rebounded from a 12-0 deficit in the opening minutes. Haliburton's
              last-second 35-footer tied the game at halftime, 64-64. He banked
              home another 3-pointer to draw Indiana within 94-93 at the
              third-quarter buzzer. The Pacers scored five times on six
              possessions in the first three minutes of crunch time, taking a
              115-110 lead with two minutes left in the fourth quarter.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then it all went to hell. Or elsewhere, depending on your
              perspective. “A lot of things had to go wrong for us and right for
              them," said Carlisle, "and they did.” Most of it from both teams
              was far from clutch. Some was extremely clutch. Did the Pacers
              fumble the bag? Did the Celtics pull one out of their
              you-know-whats? This game was all in the eye of the beholder.
            </p>
            <p>
              And this beholder thinks this kind of performance will not be
              enough against whichever Western Conference opponent awaits in the
              NBA Finals. A better team would have extinguished Boston. Would
              have being the operative phrase. We have no idea what will happen
              next, as Tuesday made crystal clear.
            </p>
            <p>
              What we do know: Boston has played 11 postseason games, won nine
              of them, and needs seven more to deliver the franchise's 18th
              championship. That was one hell of a basketball contest, the
              Celtics' first real test and one it passed — barely, but nobody
              will remember the grade we give them in this moment. We will just
              remember the chaos. As Brown said, "Welcome to the NBA playoffs."

              ‘Loss is totally on me’: Indiana Pacers head coach takes blame for
              Game 1 loss to Boston Celtics in Eastern Conference Finals
            </h1>
            <img src="./images/news4.webp" alt="" />
            <p>
              Indiana Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle said the 133-128 overtime
              loss to the Boston Celtics in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference
              Finals on Tuesday was “totally on me” after his team snatched
              defeat from the jaws of victory.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Pacers had a three-point cushion and the ball with just 10
              seconds left of regulation time, but Andrew Nembhard’s inbound
              pass to Pascal Siakam ended up in Indiana turning the ball over.
            </p>
            <p>
              The costly mistake was punished by Jaylen Brown who leveled the
              scores at 117-117 with a three-pointer from the corner. The
              Celtics then got the better of overtime to take a series lead,
              leaving Carlisle to rue the missed opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I love the way our guys fought in this game. This loss is totally
              on me. With 10 seconds of regulation, we should have just taken
              the timeout, advanced the ball and found a way to get it in,”
              Carlisle admitted to reporters after the game at Boston’s TD
              Garden.
            </p>
            <p>
              “We made some other mistakes, but our guys just need to
              concentrate on fighting the way they fought in this game, from
              start to finish.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite Carlisle taking responsibility for the chaotic end to
              regulation time, it was an error strewn night from the Pacers, who
              tallied 22 turnovers which led to 32 points for Boston, according
              to ESPN.

              Carlisle, though, wanted to focus on the positives of which there
              were some. Boston, for example, had twice led by double digits in
              the game but Indiana came back on both occasions to take the lead.

              The Pacers head coach was confident his team would recover in time
              for Game 2 on Thursday. “We did a lot of good things that we need
              to continue to do and we’ve been a tough minded, resilient team
              for almost the entire second half of the year and we have to
              continue that,” he added.

              For the Celtics, it was a morale boosting start to the series,
              with Brown and Jayson Tatum leading the charge. Tatum finished on
              a game-high 36 points, coming up clutch in overtime after Brown
              had saved the day.

              “Welcome to the NBA Playoffs,” Brown told reporters. “You’ve just
              got to manage your emotions of the game. Anything can happen. The
              game is not over until the final buzzer sounds.”

              The Celtics were also boosted by a career-best performance from
              Jrue Holiday who totalled 28 points, seven rebounds, eight
              assists, and three steals. “We’ve seen crazy stuff happen all the
              time,” Holiday told reporters.

              “I don’t think that we think we’ve lost a game until we’ve
              actually lost a game. That’s part of the reason why we were so
              resilient toward the end of the game; anything can happen.”
